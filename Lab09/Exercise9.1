a. There are 3 API endpoints (players (GET), player/id (GET, PUT, DELETE),
   and player (POST)), implemented in PlayerResource.java.
b. PlayerResource.java
	i. JDBC
	ii. Compare and contrast
		1. Both are used to access data from the database. On the other hand, a JDBC statement
		   is an object while a SQL query is just something that runs. A JDBC object executes
		   a static SQL statement and returns the result as a table. 
		2. An SQL relation refers to the table where data is stored. A JDBC result set is also 
		   a table (the result of an SQL query) stored as an object. A list of players
		   is a list which contains player objects, all of which contain their own data.
	iii. This command returns a value as a string that could be used in an SQL command. 
	   If the value is NULL, it returns an unquoted NULL, which could also be used in an 
	   SQL command. This way, no matter what gets returned it won't break your SQL code.
c. Player.java
	i. "This provides an object-oriented way to represent and manipulate player "objects" 
	   from the traditional (non-object-oriented) Monopoly database." -qtd Player.java
	ii. The Player table contains a set of tuples which contain data but are not objects. 
	   So the data from the player table can't derive new data from its own contents like 
	   the Player DAO can.
